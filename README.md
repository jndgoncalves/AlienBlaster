# First Unity Game: 2D Platformer

Welcome to my first Unity game project! This is a 2D platformer that I've been working on as a learning experience. It's not yet complete, but I've made significant progress and wanted to share it with the community.

## About the Game

This game is a classic 2D platformer where the player navigates through various levels, overcoming obstacles and challenges. I've implemented several features and mechanics using C# scripts to bring the game to life.
